# Simple Test Feature

Add a basic user management system with CRUD operations for users.

## Requirements

1. Create a User model/interface with the following fields:
   - id (number)
   - name (string)
   - email (string)
   - createdAt (Date)

2. Implement basic CRUD operations:
   - Create user
   - Read user by ID
   - Update user
   - Delete user

3. Add basic validation for:
   - Email format
   - Required fields (name, email)

4. Write unit tests for all operations

This should be a simple implementation that demonstrates the decomposition capabilities without being too complex.
