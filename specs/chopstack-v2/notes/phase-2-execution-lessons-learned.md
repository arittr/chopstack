# Phase 2 Execution Lessons Learned

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Phase**: Phase 2.4 (Migration Finalization)
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed as planned
**Reporter**: Claude (autonomous execution agent)

## Executive Summary

Phase 2.4 (task-2-9-remove-v1-type-files) was blocked when attempting to delete v1 type files due to **117 remaining TypeScript compilation errors**. Investigation revealed that prerequisite migration work from Phase 2.1 and Phase 2.3 was incomplete, leaving critical core interfaces and implementations still using v1 types.

## What Went Wrong

### 1. Incomplete Task Execution in Phase 2.1

**Task**: task-2-1-migrate-agent-implementations
**Expected**: Migrate all agent implementations (Claude, Codex, Mock) to v2 Agent interface
**Actual**: Only MockAgent was fully migrated

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/adapters/agents/claude.ts - STILL HAS V1 TYPES
// Line 218: Returns v1 Plan structure instead of PlanV2
return {
  tasks: [/* v1 Task objects */]  // Missing: name, strategy, v2 fields
}
```

**Root Cause**: Task agent completed the MockAgent implementation but didn't verify the Claude and Codex agents were also migrated. The acceptance criteria ("All agents implement v2 Agent interface") was not properly validated.

### 2. Core Interface Files Were Never Migrated

**Critical Gap**: `src/core/agents/interfaces.ts` and `src/core/execution/interfaces.ts` still used v1 types until Phase 2.4 when I manually fixed them.

**Timeline**:
- **Phase 1 (task-1-3)**: Created NEW interface file `src/types/agent.ts` with v2 types ✅
- **Phase 2.1-2.3**: Never updated EXISTING interface file `src/core/agents/interfaces.ts` ❌
- **Phase 2.4**: Discovered the discrepancy when task-2-9 blocked on type errors

**Why This Happened**: The plan specified creating `src/types/agent.ts` but the codebase also had `src/core/agents/interfaces.ts`. The task didn't account for this existing file, assuming it would be handled by task-2-1.

### 3. Parallel Execution Without Proper Verification

**Phase 2.3**: Three tasks ran in parallel (task-2-5, task-2-6, task-2-7)

**Issue**: Each task agent worked in isolation and couldn't verify that prerequisite infrastructure was complete. They proceeded assuming Phase 2.2 had fully migrated the execution infrastructure, but it hadn't.

**Evidence**:
- task-2-5 (mode handlers): Migrated successfully ✅
- task-2-6 (TUI components): Added union types (`Plan | PlanV2`) as workaround ⚠️
- task-2-7 (CLI commands): Partially migrated but couldn't complete due to type errors ⚠️

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Not Programmatically Verified

**Example from task-2-1**:
```yaml
acceptance_criteria:
  - All agents implement v2 Agent interface
  - decompose() returns PlanV2
  - No v1 type imports in agent files
  - All agent tests pass
  - TypeScript compiles with no errors  # ← THIS FAILED BUT WASN'T CHECKED
```

**Reality**: Task was marked complete despite TypeScript compilation errors existing. The agent ran tests successfully but didn't run `pnpm type-check` to verify the final acceptance criterion.

### 5. Underestimated Scope in Task Breakdown

**Original Plan**: task-2-1 was marked as "M" (Medium, 2-4 hours)

**Actual Complexity**:
- Migrate Claude agent implementation: 1-2 hours
- Migrate Codex agent implementation: 1-2 hours
- Update core interface files: 1 hour
- Fix cascading type errors: 2-3 hours
- Update all tests: 1-2 hours

**Total**: ~8-10 hours = **L or XL task**, not M

## Systematic Issues

### Issue 1: No Pre-Task Validation

Tasks didn't validate their prerequisites before starting. For example:
- task-2-9 should have run `pnpm type-check` BEFORE attempting to delete v1 files
- task-2-5/2-6/2-7 should have verified Phase 2.2 completed successfully

### Issue 2: No Post-Task Verification

Tasks were marked complete based on narrow success criteria without verifying:
- Full type-checking passes (`pnpm type-check`)
- No new compilation errors introduced
- Dependent modules still compile

### Issue 3: File Discovery Gaps

The migration plan listed specific files but missed:
- `src/core/agents/interfaces.ts` (existed but not in task files list)
- `src/core/execution/interfaces.ts` (existed but not fully in task scope)
- Many VCS service files still using v1 types

**Root Cause**: The v1 type usage audit (mentioned as prerequisite in plan.yaml) was never completed, so the full scope wasn't known.

### Issue 4: Parallel Execution Assumptions

Phase 2.3 ran 3 tasks in parallel assuming:
- Phase 2.2 (infrastructure) was complete ✅
- No shared dependencies between parallel tasks ✅
- Each task was truly independent ❌ (They all depended on core interfaces being migrated)

## What Worked Well

### 1. Incremental Progress Tracking
Each phase created commits with clear task IDs, making it easy to trace what was done:
```
7f953e2 [task-2-5-migrate-mode-handlers]
58721ee [task-2-6-migrate-tui-components]
7fa3d1b [task-2-7-migrate-cli-commands]
180c7b6 [task-2-8-update-test-files]
```

### 2. Autonomous Agent Reporting
When task-2-9 agent encountered the blocker, it:
- Attempted multiple solution approaches (type aliasing, interface migration)
- Documented all attempts and why they failed
- Provided clear blockers and recommendations
- Did NOT proceed when blocked (good safety behavior)

### 3. Test-Driven Migration Strategy
Tasks that updated test files first (task-2-8) completed successfully because:
- Tests defined the expected v2 interface clearly
- Test failures provided immediate feedback
- No production code dependencies

## Recommendations for Future Phases

### 1. Add Pre-Task Validation Gates

Before executing any task:
```yaml
pre_conditions:
  - command: pnpm type-check
    expect: zero_errors
  - command: pnpm test
    expect: all_pass
  - verify: all_prerequisite_tasks_complete
```

### 2. Add Post-Task Verification

After executing any task:
```yaml
post_conditions:
  - command: pnpm type-check
    expect: zero_errors_or_no_increase
  - command: pnpm test -- [affected tests]
    expect: all_pass
  - verify: acceptance_criteria_met
```

### 3. Complete Prerequisites First

**Required BEFORE Phase 2 starts**:
```yaml
prerequisites:
  - name: "V1 Type Usage Audit"
    deliverable: "specs/chopstack-v2/notes/v1-type-usage-audit.md"
    content:
      - List of ALL files importing from @/types/decomposer
      - List of ALL files using Plan, Task types
      - List of ALL interface files that define agent contracts
      - Estimated lines of code per migration area
```

### 4. Add "Integration Verification" Tasks

Between phases, add verification tasks:
```yaml
- id: task-2-X-verify-phase-2-integration
  name: Verify Phase 2.1-2.3 Integration
  description: |
    Run full type-check and tests to verify all Phase 2 tasks
    integrate correctly before proceeding to finalization.
  files: []  # No file changes, just verification
  acceptance_criteria:
    - pnpm type-check returns 0 errors
    - pnpm test returns 100% pass rate
    - No v1 type imports in migrated files
```

### 5. Revise Task Complexity Estimates

Use this formula for migration tasks:
```
Complexity = (Files × 0.5h) + (Tests × 0.25h) + (Dependencies × 1h) + (Integration × 1h)

Example: task-2-1 (migrate agents)
- Files: 3 agent files × 0.5h = 1.5h
- Tests: 3 test files × 0.25h = 0.75h
- Dependencies: 2 core interfaces × 1h = 2h
- Integration: Verify agents work with pipeline = 1h
Total: 5.25h = L complexity (not M)
```

### 6. Add "Smoke Test" Phase

After Phase 2 completes, add Phase 2.5:
```yaml
- id: phase-2-5-smoke-tests
  name: Integration Smoke Tests
  strategy: sequential
  tasks:
    - Run decompose with real spec
    - Run validate mode on sample plan
    - Run execute mode in dry-run
    - Run full e2e test suite
```

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Emergency Remediation (Fast but Risky)

Create new tasks to fix remaining issues:

```yaml
- id: task-2-11-fix-agent-implementations
  complexity: L
  files:
    - src/adapters/agents/claude.ts
    - src/adapters/agents/codex.ts
    - src/adapters/agents/__tests__/*.test.ts

- id: task-2-12-fix-planning-infrastructure
  complexity: M
  files:
    - src/services/planning/plan-generator.ts
    - src/services/planning/__tests__/*.test.ts

- id: task-2-13-fix-vcs-services
  complexity: L
  files:
    - src/services/vcs/strategies/*.ts
    - src/services/vcs/validation/*.ts
    - src/core/vcs/*.ts
```

**Estimate**: 3 sequential tasks × 4-6 hours each = **12-18 hours additional work**

### Option B: Rollback and Replan (Slow but Thorough)

1. Document current state in detail
2. Complete the v1 type usage audit that should have been done pre-Phase 2
3. Revise Phase 2 plan with:
   - More granular task breakdown
   - Explicit core interface migration tasks
   - Integration verification checkpoints
4. Re-execute Phase 2 with improved plan

**Estimate**: **20-30 hours** (audit + replan + re-execution)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Balanced)

1. Complete minimal fixes to unblock (fix 4 critical files manually): **2-3 hours**
   - src/adapters/agents/claude.ts
   - src/adapters/agents/codex.ts
   - src/services/planning/plan-generator.ts
   - src/commands/decompose/decompose-command.ts

2. Run task-2-9 (remove v1 files) with these fixes: **30 min**

3. Fix remaining errors as they appear: **4-6 hours**

4. Document lessons learned for future migrations: **1 hour**

**Total Estimate**: **8-11 hours**

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **TypeScript Errors at Phase 2.4 Start** | 117 | Should have been 0 |
| **Files Still Using V1 Types** | 29 | From grep analysis |
| **Incomplete Phase 2.1 Tasks** | 1/3 | task-2-1 only migrated MockAgent |
| **Tasks Marked Complete But Failing** | 3 | task-2-1, parts of task-2-5/2-6/2-7 |
| **Manual Fixes Required** | 4 files | Core interfaces I fixed manually |
| **Time Lost to Rework** | ~4 hours | This analysis + manual fixes |

## Conclusion

The Phase 2 migration plan was well-structured at a high level but failed in execution due to:

1. **Missing prerequisite audit** - Never completed v1 type usage analysis
2. **Incomplete task execution** - Agents didn't fully complete their assignments
3. **No validation gates** - Tasks proceeded without verifying prerequisites
4. **Underestimated complexity** - M tasks were actually L or XL
5. **Parallel execution assumptions** - Assumed independence that didn't exist

**The core lesson**: For large-scale type migrations, **verification gates at every step** are not optional. A single incomplete task can block an entire phase.

## Appendix: Error Categories Breakdown

From `pnpm type-check` output (117 total errors):

| Category | Count | Example Files |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Agent implementation type mismatches | 15 | claude.ts, codex.ts |
| CLI command type errors | 12 | decompose-command.ts, run-command.ts |
| Planning infrastructure v1 usage | 8 | plan-generator.ts |
| VCS service v1 references | 18 | vcs strategies, validation |
| Test file v1 types | 32 | Various __tests__ files |
| Execution infrastructure | 12 | orchestration, modes |
| UI component type issues | 8 | TUI hooks, components |
| Misc type compatibility | 12 | Various scattered issues |

## Appendix: Files Still Importing from `@/types/decomposer`

```
src/adapters/agents/claude.ts
src/adapters/agents/codex.ts
src/commands/decompose/decompose-command.ts
src/commands/run/run-command.ts
src/services/planning/plan-generator.ts
src/services/vcs/strategies/stacked-vcs-strategy.ts
src/services/vcs/strategies/simple-vcs-strategy.ts
src/services/vcs/strategies/worktree-vcs-strategy.ts
src/services/vcs/validation/*.ts
src/core/vcs/vcs-strategy.ts
src/core/execution/task-transitions.ts
src/ui/hooks/useExecutionState.ts
src/ui/TuiApp.tsx
... (29 files total)
```

These files must be migrated before v1 types can be safely removed.
